### User journey focused: assumptions about how people find us and what they look at once they did.

#### How people find us:
- We write applications.
- Good opportunities also come via personal/professional connections.
- People find us via web search and look at landing page.

#### What they look at once they found us:
- Who are these people. 
  - Is it a company, are they in Germany?
  - Link to Privacy, Imprint, Legal status
  - What did they do so far, what is their experience?
  - How many of them are there, 
  - what are their backgrounds, 

- Past projects, 
  - what size 
  - what scope
  - which technologies were used?
- Ease to find this info.
  - If I have to look for everything, I get anoyed.
- Quality of work / transparency of processes:
  - any code I can look at?
  - any indicators of how professionally they are working

#### Status Quo

- From the Imprint:
  - They are a company, they are situated in germany, Levin Keller is CEO
  - How many are they? Not clear. Only hint: Four prople in the github org. But thats only for nerds to find out.

- Professional appearance of Homepage:
  - Design best practices: Could use a proper image in the Hero section.
  - Consistency:
    - Dienstleistungen/Services links to page root
    - Software Section only german - going there als switches language settings to german. Were I an english native, I'd be confused.
    - Switching language brings be back to page root, even though I'd expect it to just change the language.
  - Value Proposition: Yes looks good so far,
  - Legal stuff: Link to Privacy Policy missing,
  - Only two past projects, one of them is their own website. Thats not much.

- Discoverability
  - No google maps Link
  - Google Maps search:
    - webentwicklung berlin agentur: no
    - softwareentwicklung berlin blockchain: no
    - softwareentwicklung berlin fundament: no
    - hardfork berlin: 3rd
    - softwareentwicklung hardfork 4th
    - software development hardfork 1st and 2nd
  - bottom line: to find hardfork, you have to know hardfork.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Homepage Consistency
- Homepage formal/legal compliance
- Transparancy about/Advertisement of past projects
- Discoverability. Put the Company on some lists and link it where we can. Will also improve google search results.
- Google listing: SEO check our content and fix [some faux pas](https://sitechecker.pro/app/main/project/1091572/audit/summary), List the company on google maps

#### Action Items:

- Link to Privacy
- Fix link to services
- Link to github larger?
- Image for Hero section
- English version of software page
- fix language picker on landing page (only change language, don't reload page)
- List more past projects!
- Google maps entry?
- Fix most obvious SEO faux pas, see e.g. [this seo check sumary](https://sitechecker.pro/app/main/project/1091572/audit/summary)
- SEO optimization of content (keywords)
- Generate some backlinks (e.g. put Hardfork in all the registers that we can find)
-
